# Backend For https://github.com/RajivRamaiah/Blog-Redux/tree/auth

This is a node app running express.js that uses Mongoose to communicate with a MongoDB instance to store post and user information for the Blog at the link above. For this part of the assignment, I added in authentication support. This involved storing user objects, which meant creating a new User Model to hold user information. To encrypt passwords we used the bcrypt-nodejs module and used a pre-save hook to salt and hash passwords for a user before the object was saved. The user controller then uses the jyt-simple node module to encode and decode JWTs. When a user signs in we generate a new token, but when a user signs up we first verify that the new user object hasn't been created before, and if it has deny the sign up. Passport.js was used for authentication services. The locallogin and jwtLogin methods are used to authenticate the email and password of a user and then confirm that the user exists. Finally, I added in the authentication routes for /signin and /signup so that the backend is ready to be used.
